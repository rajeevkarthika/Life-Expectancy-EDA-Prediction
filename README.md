# Identifying the key factors influencing life expectancy and life expectancy prediction
The goal of this project is to analyse the [Life Expectancy dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who) retrived from the data science community [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). The dataset contains information about life expectancy and various economic, health, and social factors for 193 countries collected from 2000 to 2015. 

In this project, we identified key features influencing life expectancy and built regression models to predict life expectancy. More precisely:

+ Analysed the life expectancy dataset retrieved from Kaggle,
+ Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis,
+ Identified vital features affecting life expectancy,
+ Developed and compared regression models to predict life expectancy.

This analysis is based in **Python** and used **NumPy** and **pandas** for data manipulation, **matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualisation and **scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms.
